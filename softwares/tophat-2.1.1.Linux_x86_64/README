TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns RNA-Seq
reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read
aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice
junctions between exons.

TopHat2 (the current release) is a collaborative effort between the Center for Computational Biology at
Johns Hopkins University and the Genome Sciences Department at the University of Washington.
